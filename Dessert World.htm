<h3>Introduccion</h3><p>
A dessert is a type of food that is eaten after lunch or dinner, and sometimes after a light meal or snack. It is usually a sweet food, like ice cream, cookies, and cakes. 
In this website we will show our favourites and the best places to get them.

<h3><b>Reasons to love desserts</b></h3>
Dessert is not only delicious, but it also helps you keep a balanced diet.
Eating healthy doesn't mean only eating tons of vegetables. 
In fact, dessert can actually help you receive your daily amount of required nutrients. 
And it also make you happy and enjoy memorable times with your love ones.

<h2><b>Top 3 desserts</b></h2>
Well, to be honest it was really hard for us to get our 3 favourite ones but here they are. 
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><b>Blondie</b></h2>
On the third place we chose Blondie because of the thick texture and the different flavour.
In addition, if you try it with ice cream on top, it will make it so much better.

<h2><b>NY Cheesecake</b></h2>

Second we got the famous NY Cheescake, it's incredibly good and we can assure you will be speechless after trying it.
Two really good places to eat it are Lucio Cafe and Sienna Bakery. 
We advice you to eat the not bake version because in our opinion it's not that tasty as the frozen one.

<h2><b>Carrot Cake</b></h2>

Finally, the best dessert of all times for us is "Carrot Cake", is it really necesary to explain why? 
We don't think so, the combination between the cake and the cream cheese frosting, plus the manjar de olla make this cake really amazing. 
However, you need to be careful where to buy it because the flavour may not be the same. 
But don't worry we will give you great recommendations.

<h2><b>Best places to eat dessert</b></h2>
Now, we will share the best places for us to get a good dessert based in our experiences and we'll review some of the things we got in each of them.
While Nicole was in Lima we decided to rate desserts from different cafe's.
And it went really great, we had a wonderful time in most of the places but we were also dissapointed on some of them because we expected more.
If you wonder was it expensive? Well, yes kinda but it was worth it. Let's start
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2><b>La Principal</b></h2>
This place has the best carrot cake in the world, it is served warm and it's a big slice. 
We've been here twice, the first time we ordered carrot cake and key lime pye, both were amazing.
The second time, we went with our friends and we all share, so here are our thoughts about some
of the desserts, the berries cheescake was delicious and so was the blondie, but the red velvet
cheescake and the gelatto oreo cokie were just not good, not enough for the price and well the ice 
cream was a classic but refreshing. The place itself it's not big but comfortable and good to go 
with your friends and family.

<h2><b>Sienna Bakery</b></h2>
Where the cookie lovers at? Hear this out, if you love cookies, it's your lucky day. Sienna Bakery has the best cookies we've ever tried, the insane quantity of flavours and the quality of the product 
make this place a must to go. The cookies are filled with differents things, they are also big and perfectly sweet (not so little, not a lot).
In our visit we tried the manjar blanco de olla cookie, key lime pie cookie, mango cheescake and the classic one, all of them were so good.
The price is fair enough, it goes around 8 to 12 soles per cookie.
But that's not it, there you can also get other kind of dessert like alfajor, cheescake, carrot cake (we didn't like this one), red velvet cake and more.

<h2><b>Lucio Caffé</b></h2>
From here, without a doubt, the prize of the NY Cheescake takes it, it is very rich and worth its price.
 It is a fairly spacious and comfortable place.
The attention and the atmosphere are perfect. 
Another good option is the apple puff pastry or the jars (they are glass containers with a choice of dessert inside), 
and although the brownie had a good flavor, it is very small and not worth its price.
But overall this place is spectacular.
